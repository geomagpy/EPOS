## 1. Prerequisites for using these notebooks

### 1.1 Installing Python and setup of environments

All provided notebooks make use of Python >= 3.7. It is highly recommended to use a specific python environment.
On **Linux** you can install such environment as follows:

        $ apt install python3-virtualenv

Then you can create a new environment called magpy as follows:

        $ virtualenv ~/env/epos

Switch to this environment

        $ source ~/env/epos/bin/activate

On **Windows** ...

### 1.2 Installation of the requires python packages


        (epos)$ pip install geomagpy
        (epos)$ pip install notebook
