## 1. Prerequisites for using these notebooks

### 1.1 Installing Python and setup of environments

All provided notebooks make use of Python >= 3.7. It is highly recommended to use a specific python environment.
On **Linux** you can install such environment as follows:

        $ apt install python3-virtualenv

Then you can create a new environment called magpy as follows:

        $ virtualenv ~/env/epos

Switch to this environment

        $ source ~/env/epos/bin/activate

On **Windows** you can use [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/). Download a recent version
and unzip by executing it. Go to the unzipped folder and run a WinPython terminal to continue with the
following steps.

On **MacOS** it is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) and follow the anaconda instructions for environments.


### 1.2 Installation of the requires python packages


        (epos)$ pip install geomagpy
        (epos)$ pip install notebook

### 1.3 Running and editing the jupyter notebooks

Clone or download the jupyter notebooks to your local directory.

Go to that directory and run

         jupyter notebook

Open the notebook of your choice
